# Getting Started with Bus React App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

P.S if you would change port just make sure that the @CrossOrigin annotation has the same port in the backend controller to allow the client to fetch data from the server.
