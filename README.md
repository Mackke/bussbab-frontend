# Getting Started with Bus React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

P.S if you would change port just make sure that the @CrossOrigin annotation has the same port in the backend controller to allow the client to fetch data from the server.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
